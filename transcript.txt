0:01
co-founders here at Tris I wanted to
0:04
welcome you today to learning more about
0:05
the platform and just walk you through
0:07
what trus does trellis is an AI co-pilot
0:10
that works where you work what that
0:12
means is trellis will do everything
0:14
you've come to expect from the latest
0:16
and greatest of AI tools but will do it
0:18
inside of your existing sales tool
0:20
Stacks you don't have tool fatigue or
0:22
tool switch overhead you can just work
0:24
how you work and get that AI assist when
0:26
you need it we do primarily four things
0:29
we research your prospects we generate
0:31
personalized cold emails we automate all
0:33
your cold call admin work so that you
0:35
don't have to do notes dispositions
0:38
you'll just be in calls at all times and
0:40
then we coach you live on your calls on
0:43
what to say what we're going to do here
0:45
first is show you the platform inside
0:47
one of the platforms that we support
0:48
which is called Outreach and then we're
0:50
going to just show you some of the other
0:53
analytics dashboards that tralis can
0:54
bring you as a manager so just to get
0:57
started here let's open up Outreach and
0:58
move in so I have Outreach opened up
1:01
here um I have some tasks loaded and I'm
1:03
just going to show you some of these
1:05
admin assists that trus will do for you
1:07
so the first part is really that
1:08
research aspect that I was talking about
1:10
Charles will go and find you know that
1:12
person's LinkedIn in case you want to
1:14
find it cool so I can confirm that this
1:15
is Raven at bellil I can also then look
1:19
at you know any previous calls that I've
1:21
had with them I've you know blasted
1:22
Raven a bunch of times you know that's
1:24
just how you have to do it in Cold's
1:25
calling you have to be persistent uh and
1:28
then it'll generate any information
1:29
about their company that I can look into
1:32
uh and then you know I can look into
1:33
their LinkedIn if I want to go and
1:35
request that data finally if I wanted to
1:38
I could generate a personalized email
1:39
from here I could also do it natively
1:41
inside the platform just from their
1:43
email widget so I can click here click
1:45
generate email with one click trus will
1:48
use my past call context and any
1:50
information about their company to
1:52
generate that email for me I can then
1:54
chat with the AI to you know ask
1:56
questions about hey you know I want to
1:59
make this email include more details
2:03
about their
2:04
company I can send that over Charles
2:07
will then learn from you know the prompt
2:09
that you're giving similar to how chat
2:10
GPT works and then include that
2:12
information directly here you can then
2:14
of course copy this paste in and just
2:16
paste the email and send it off awesome
2:20
so what does trus do for cold calling
2:23
well if you might see here trus converts
2:25
your existing sales platform into an
2:27
auto dialer what that means is when I
2:29
press play here Char is going to
2:30
automate all the work associated with
2:32
calling whether that's disposition
2:34
figuring out what number to call if that
2:36
person's in the right time zone all that
2:37
will be done automatically for you and
2:39
the kicker is you can listen to music
2:41
while you're doing it if you click the
2:42
music icon right here so let's just do
2:44
one example call and check how it works
2:46
so it's going to dial that work number
2:48
it's telling me it's doing that it's
2:49
going to dial the number
2:53
automat and then on the right hand side
2:55
over here you're going to see TRS
2:56
actually pop up in context on what
2:59
happened on the last call so that you're
3:00
prepared for the conversation as it
3:02
happens Char will also automate hanging
3:05
up on a call if it rings for too long or
3:07
if it goes to voicemail and then finally
3:09
you know it will give you any
3:11
suggestions based off what they say so
3:13
I'm going to pick up here I'd secretly
3:14
put my number in and on the other end
3:16
and I'm GNA give an example of something
3:18
saying like hey you know I'm not
3:21
interested or something like that um and
3:24
then Charles is just going to give me
3:25
suggestion on what I can do in this
3:26
scenario based off my opener it's going
3:28
to give me coaching suggestion on you
3:30
know I should probably speak slower
3:32
information like that finally as soon as
3:34
I end the call here Charles is going to
3:36
automatically generate a call summary
3:38
for me it's going to log the call for me
3:40
say they were busy move on and get to
3:42
the next conversation automatically so
3:44
this is done automatically for you it's
3:46
a fully hands-free dialing experience
3:48
that you can experience inside your
3:49
existing platforms now if I want to stop
3:51
it here I can just press pause and
3:53
Charles will stop cool this also works
3:57
across other supported platforms whether
3:59
it be sales Loft whether it be HubSpot
4:02
or whether you know it be Apollo so in
4:05
Apollo you just go to your tasks
4:08
View and then you can click into the
4:10
first call task that you have or
4:12
LinkedIn task of course it will just
4:13
find it for you automatically and then
4:15
the auto dier will pop up right here for
4:17
you
4:18
automatically awesome the final aspects
